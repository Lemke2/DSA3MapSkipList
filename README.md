Project for my DSA3 class where we had to create a sortedMap using skipLists.

Using an OOP approach where we split the code in to 3 parts:

SkipListBase contains the code of Node and the basics of the skipLists structure.

PositionalList abstracts away the Nodes with a Position class used for encapsulation.

SortedMap class provides the standard ordered Map functions using the base classes for efficient operations.
